# CNL Background
CNL is a domain-specific language meant to build data-transformation interfaces for non-technical users. The intended use case is for it to be used by programmers building bespoke data-processing GUIs for their non-programming colleagues. For example, a team of social scientists might have one teammate with programming experience. Ideally, this programmer would be able to use CNL to build data-processing interfaces for their teammates when faced with some data transformation task too large to be done manually.

Using CNL, programmers write each interface using a `Tool`. Each `Tool` has an underlying database which maintains state and data which users can interact with through `Stages`. Within each `Tool`, programmers can define multiple `Stages`, each of which can be used by the users to accomplish a specific data transformation task. For example, you (the programmer) could define one `Stage` to do some sort of filtering over a particular dataset, or a basic `Stage` where the user is just uploading a new dataset. What the user sees in each `Stage` is defined by its Components, which are the building blocks of the layout of the `Stage`. Components also provide fields where the user is able to provide inputs. What happens with this data is defined in the `Stage`'s `Processor`, whose results can be presented to the user for approval, or immediately saved.
